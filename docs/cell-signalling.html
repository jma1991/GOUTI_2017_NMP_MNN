Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jma1991/GOUTI_2017_NMP_MNN/tree/80deb0e2109b397c5826eb8665d64f25b9ec0147" target="_blank">80deb0e</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
